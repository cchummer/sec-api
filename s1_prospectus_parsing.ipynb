This prospectus contains forward-looking statements, based on current expectations and relatedto future events and our future financial performance, that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may vary materially fromthose discussed in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including, without limitation, those set forth under“Risk Factors,” as well as other matters described in this prospectus. See “Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-LookingStatements.” Overview Ainos,Inc. (the “Company”), incorporated in the State of Texas in 1984, is a diversified healthcare company focused on the developmentof novel point-of-care testing (the “POCT”), therapeutics based on very low-dose interferon alpha (the “VELDONA”),and synthetic RNA-driven preventative medicine. Our product pipeline includes commercial-stage VELDONA Pet cytoprotein supplements, clinical-stageVELDONA human therapeutics and telehealth-friendly POCTs powered by the AI Nose technology platform. Wehave historically involved in the research and development of therapeutics based on VELDONA. Building on our research and developmenton VELDONA since inception, we are focused on commercializing a suite of VELDONA-based products including VELDONA Pet cytoprotein supplementsand human related VELDONA therapeutics. In2021 and 2022, we acquired certain types of intellectual property from controlling shareholder, Ainos Inc., a Cayman Island corporation(“Ainos KY”), to expand product portfolio into POCTs aimed to provide connected, rapid, and convenient testing for a broadrange of health conditions. Pivoting from the sales of COVID-19 POCT, we aim to commercialize POCTs that detect volatile organic compounds(the “VOC”) emitted by the body, powered by our AI Nose technology platform. Our lead VOC POCT candidate, Ainos Flora, aimsto test female vaginal health and certain common sexually transmitted infections (the “STIs”) quickly and easily. Webelieve the following attributes differentiate us from other diversified life science companies: - Intuitive, telehealth-friendly point-of-care testing; - AI-powered VOC testing platform; - decades of proprietary low-dose oral interferon clinical research; - capital-efficient business model; - outsourced manufacturing; and - global distribution relationships.

Implicationsof Being a Smaller Reporting Company Weare a “smaller reporting company” as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, andhave elected to take advantage of certain of the scaled disclosures available to smaller reporting companies. Accordingly, we may provideless public disclosure than larger public companies, including the inclusion of only two years of audited consolidated financial statementsand only two years of management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations disclosure and theinclusion of reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements. As a smaller reporting company, we are also exempt fromcompliance with the auditor attestation requirements pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As a result, the information that we provideto our stockholders may be different than you might receive from other public reporting companies in which you hold equity interests.We will continue to be a “smaller reporting company” until we have $250 million or more in public float (based on our commonstock) measured as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or, in the event we have no public floator a public float (based on our common stock) that is less than $700 million, annual revenues of $100 million or more during the mostrecently completed fiscal year.

This summary does not contain all of the information that you should consider before making an investment decision. You should carefully read the entire prospectus, including under the section titled “Risk Factors” and the documents incorporated by reference into this prospectus, before making an investment decision. Our Company We are a clinical and preclinical stage oncology-focused RNAi nanoparticle drug development company utilizing a novel technology that achieves systemic delivery for target-specific protein inhibition for any gene product that is over-expressed in disease. Our drug delivery and antisense technology, called DNAbilize ® , is a platform that uses P-ethoxy, which is a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) backbone modification that is intended to protect the DNA from destruction by the body’s enzymes when circulating in vivo, incorporated inside of a lipid bilayer having neutral charge. We believe this combination allows for high efficiency loading of antisense DNA into non-toxic, cell-membrane-like structures for delivery of the antisense drug substance into cells. In vivo, the DNAbilize ® delivered antisense drug substances are systemically distributed throughout the body to allow for reduction or elimination of target proteins in blood diseases and solid tumors. Through testing in numerous animal studies and dosing in clinical trials, our DNAbilize ® drug candidates have demonstrated an excellent safety profile. DNAbilize ® is a registered trademark of the Company. Using DNAbilize ® as a platform for drug development and manufacturing, we currently have four drug candidates in development to treat at least five different cancer disease indications. Our lead drug candidate, prexigebersen (pronounced prex” i je ber’ sen), which targets growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (“Grb2”), initially started the efficacy portion of a Phase 2 clinical trial for untreated acute myeloid leukemia (“AML”) patients in combination with low-dose cytarabine (“LDAC”). The interim data presented in the 2018 American Society of Hematology (“ASH”) Annual Meeting showed that 11 (65%) of the 17 evaluable patients had a response, including five (29%) who achieved complete remission (“CR”), inclusive of one CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (“CRi”) and one morphologic leukemia-free state, and six (35%) stable disease responses, including two patients who had greater than a 50% reduction in bone marrow blasts. However, DNA hypomethylating agents are now the most frequently used agents in the treatment of elderly AML patients in the U.S. and Europe. As a result, Stage 2 of the Phase 2 trial in AML was amended to remove the combination treatment of prexigebersen and LDAC and replace it with the combination treatment of prexigebersen and decitabine, a DNA hypomethylating agent, for treatment of a second cohort of untreated AML patients. Since decitabine is also used as a treatment for relapsed/refractory AML patients, a cohort of relapsed/refractory AML patients was also added to the study. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) granted approval of venetoclax in combination with LDAC, decitabine or azacytidine (the latter two drugs are DNA hypomethylating agents) as frontline therapy for newly diagnosed AML in adults who are 75 years or older, or who have comorbidities precluding intensive induction chemotherapy. We believe this approval of the frontline venetoclax and decitabine combination therapy provides an opportunity for combining prexigebersen with the combination therapy for the treatment of newly diagnosed AML patients. Preclinical efficacy studies for the triple combination treatment of prexigebersen, decitabine and venetoclax in AML have been successfully completed. In the preclinical efficacy studies, four AML cancer cell lines were treated with three different combinations of decitabine, venetoclax and prexigebersen. Decrease in AML cell viability was the primary measure of efficacy. The triple combination of decitabine, venetoclax and prexigebersen showed significant improvement in efficacy in three of the four AML cell lines. Based on these results, we believe that adding prexigebersen to the treatment combination of decitabine and venetoclax could lead to improved efficacy in AML patients. Accordingly, we further amended Stage 2 of this Phase 2 clinical trial to add the triple combination treatment comprised of prexigebersen, decitabine and venetoclax. Our approved amended Stage 2 for this Phase 2 clinical trial currently has three cohorts of patients. The first two cohorts will treat patients with the triple combination of prexigebersen, decitabine and venetoclax. The first cohort will include untreated AML patients, and the second cohort will include relapsed/ refractory AML patients. Finally, the third cohort will treat relapsed/refractory AML patients, who are 1 TABLE OF CONTENTS venetoclax-resistant or -intolerant, with the two-drug combination of prexigebersen and decitabine. The full trial design plans have approximately 98 evaluable patients for the first cohort having untreated AML patients with a preliminary review performed after 19 evaluable patients and a formal interim analysis after 38 evaluable patients. The full trial design plans have approximately 54 evaluable patients for each of the second cohort, having relapsed/refractory AML patients, and the third cohort, having AML patients who are venetoclax-resistant or -intolerant, in each case with a review performed after 19 evaluable patients. The study is anticipated to be conducted at up to ten clinical sites in the U.S., and Gail J. Roboz, MD, is the national coordinating Principal Investigator for the Phase 2 trial. Dr. Roboz is a professor of medicine and director of the Clinical and Translational Leukemia Program at the Weill Medical College of Cornell University (the “Weill Medical College”) and the New York-Presbyterian Hospital in New York City. On August 13, 2020, we announced the enrollment and dosing of the first patient in this approved amended Stage 2 of the Phase 2 clinical trial. The safety run-in of Stage 2 of the Phase 2 clinical study was successfully completed, and the preliminary data was presented at the 2021 ASH Annual Meeting. In the safety run-in of the triple combination, six evaluable patients were treated with the combination of prexigebersen, decitabine and venetoclax. These patients included four relapsed/refractory AML patients, and two newly diagnosed AML patients. Five patients (83%) responded to treatment, including four (67%) achieving CR/CRi/MLFS and one (17%) achieving partial remission (“PR”). Recent publications provide that response (CR + CRi) rates to combination treatment with decitabine and venetoclax (but without prexigebersen) are 42 to 52% for relapsed/ refractory AML patients and 0 to 39% for relapsed/refractory secondary AML patients. Response rates to frontline treatment with decitabine and venetoclax (but without prexigebersen) are 54 to 74% for newly diagnosed AML patients. These preliminary data showed the treatment was well-tolerated and there were no dose limiting toxicities attributed to prexigebersen. Three patients remained on treatment for more than one cycle. On August 1, 2023, we announced interim data for the first two cohorts of the amended Stage 2 of the Phase 2 clinical trial. Fourteen newly diagnosed patients were evaluable in the first cohort and treated with at least one cycle of the prexigebersen, decitabine and venetoclax combination therapy. All patients in the first cohort (median age 75) were adverse risk by 2017 European LeukemiaNet (“ELN”) guidelines (n=10) or secondary AML (n=4). Prexigebersen was well-tolerated, and adverse events (“AEs”) were generally consistent with decitabine and venetoclax treatment and/or for AML. Twelve of the 14 evaluable patients (86%) achieved CR/CRi and two (14%) achieved PR. In total, 100% of the evaluable patients had a response to treatment. The CR/CRi rates of 86% for the evaluable patients in the first cohort is significantly higher than the CR/CRi rates of 62% for newly diagnosed patients treated with the frontline combination treatment of decitabine and venetoclax. Fourteen refractory/relapsed evaluable AML patients in the second cohort were treated with at least one cycle of the prexigebersen, decitabine and venetoclax combination therapy. Substantially all of the patients in the second cohort (median age 56.5) were adverse risk by 2017 ELN guidelines (n=11) or secondary AML (n=2). Prexigebersen was well-tolerated, and AEs were generally consistent with decitabine and venetoclax treatment and/or for AML. Eight of the 14 evaluable refractory/ relapsed patients (57%) achieved CR/CRi, two (14%) achieved PR and two (22%) achieved stable disease. In total, 93% of the evaluable patients in the second cohort had a response to treatment. The CR/CRi rates of 57% for the evaluable refractory and relapsed patients in the second cohort is significantly higher than the CR/CRi rates of 21% for refractory/relapsed patients treated with the combination treatment of decitabine and venetoclax. Based on this interim data, we currently plan to pursue FDA expedited programs for Fast Track designation, and we are evaluating whether to seek to expand Stage 2 of the Phase 2 clinical trial in Europe. Grb2 is involved in activating the RAS/ERK pathway for cell growth. By blocking the cell’s ability to produce Grb2, prexigebersen treatment may limit cell growth. In obesity, two such pathways are related to leptin and insulin. Activation of leptin or insulin receptors can stimulate the RAS/ERK pathway via Grb2. 1 We believe development of prexigebersen for the treatment for obesity and obesity-related cancers could be accelerated given the large amount of safety data from prexigebersen treatment of leukemia patients and 1 blacklining:none; (Casado ME et al. (2023) Recent Advances in the Knowledge of the Mechanisms of Leptin Physiology and Actions in Neurological and Metabolic Pathologies. Int J Mol Sci 24(2): 1422. Published online 2023 Jan 11. doi: 10.3390/ijms24021422) 2 TABLE OF CONTENTS the continued unmet medical need. The Company expects to evaluate prexigebersen for the treatment of obesity as soon as corporate resources are sufficient. Our second drug candidate, Liposomal Bcl-2 (“BP1002”), targets the protein Bcl-2, which is responsible for driving cell survival in up to 60% of all cancers. A Phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the ability of BP1002 to treat refractory/relapsed lymphoma and refractory/relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (“CLL”) patients has been initiated. The Phase 1 clinical trial is being conducted at the Georgia Cancer Center while two additional clinical trial sites are currently being activated for inclusion in the study, The University of Texas Southwestern and New York Medical College. On January 10, 2024, we announced the successful completion of the first dose cohort in the Phase 1 clinical trial. A total of six evaluable patients are scheduled to be treated with BP1002 monotherapy in a standard 3+3 design, unless there is a dose limiting toxicity which would require an additional three patients to be tested. There were no dose limiting toxicities in the first dose cohort (20 mg/m 2 ). Enrollment is now open for patients for the second BP1002 dose cohort of 40 mg/m 2 . Additionally, preclinical studies suggest that the combination of BP1002 with decitabine is efficacious in venetoclax-resistant leukemia and lymphoma cells. An abstract of the preclinical study was presented at the 2021 American Association for Cancer Research (“AACR”) Annual Meeting. A Phase 1/1b clinical trial to investigate the ability of BP1002 to treat refractory/relapsed AML patients, including venetoclax-resistant patients, is being studied. A recent study 2 found that AML patients who had relapsed from frontline venetoclax-based treatment had a very poor prognosis, with a median survival of less than three months. Since venetoclax and BP1002 utilize different mechanisms of action, we believe that BP1002 may be a potential treatment for venetoclax-relapsed AML patients. The Phase 1/1b clinical trial is being conducted at several leading cancer centers in the United States, including the Weill Medical College, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (“MD Anderson”), Scripps Health and The University of California at Los Angeles Cancer Center. On December 14, 2023, we announced the successful completion of the first dose cohort of the dose escalation portion of the Phase 1/1b clinical trial of BP1002; and on April 18, 2024, we announced the successful completion of the second dose cohort. The testing of these two dose levels is now complete and the clinical trial will pause for a brief data review by the FDA, and then we expect that dose testing will continue at the next planned higher dose of 60 mg/m2. The approved treatment cycle is two doses per week over four weeks, resulting in eight doses administered over twenty-eight days. The Phase 1b portion of the study is expected to commence after completion of BP1002 monotherapy cohorts and will assess the safety and efficacy of BP1002 in combination with decitabine in refractory/relapsed AML patients. Our third drug candidate, Liposomal STAT3 (“BP1003”), targets the STAT3 protein and is currently in IND enabling studies as a potential treatment of pancreatic cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”) and AML. Preclinical models have shown BP1003 to inhibit cell viability and STAT3 protein expression in NSCLC and AML cell lines. Further, BP1003 successfully penetrated pancreatic tumors ex vivo and significantly enhanced the efficacy of gemcitabine, a treatment for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer, in a pancreatic cancer patient derived tumor model. An abstract of the preclinical study was presented at the 2019 AACR Annual Meeting. Our lead indication for BP1003 is pancreatic cancer due to the severity of this disease and the lack of effective, life-extending treatments. For example, pancreatic adenocarcinoma is projected to be the second most lethal cancer behind lung cancer by 2030. Typical survival for a metastatic pancreatic cancer patient is about three to six months from diagnosis. Additionally, an abstract of the preclinical study demonstrating that BP1003 enhanced the sensitivity of breast and ovarian cancer cells to chemotherapy was presented at the 2022 AACR Annual Meeting. We have successfully completed several IND enabling studies of BP1003 and have one additional IND enabling study to complete. Once the additional study is successfully completed, our goal is to file an IND application and initiate the first-in-humans Phase 1 study of BP1003 in patients with refractory, metastatic solid tumors, including pancreatic cancer and NSCLC. In addition, a modified product named BP1001-A, our fourth drug candidate, has shown to enhance chemotherapy efficacy in preclinical solid tumor models. Results of the preclinical study were published in 2 blacklining:none; (Maiti A, Ruasch C, Cortes JE, et.al. Outcomes of relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia after frontline hypomethylating agent and venetoclax regimens. Haematologica 2021; 106: 894-898.) 3 TABLE OF CONTENTS the scientific journal Oncotarget in July 2020. BP1001-A incorporates the same drug substance as prexigebersen but has a slightly modified formulation designed to enhance nanoparticle properties. A BP1001-A Phase 1/1b clinical trial in patients with advanced or recurrent solid tumors has been initiated. The Phase 1/1b clinical trial is being conducted at several leading cancer centers in the United States, including MD Anderson, Karmanos Cancer Institute, Mary Crowley Cancer Research and Holy Cross Hospital, Maryland. On July 17, 2023, we announced completion of the first cohort of the dose escalation portion of the Phase 1/1b clinical trial. A total of nine evaluable patients are scheduled to be treated with BP1001-A monotherapy in a standard 3+3 dose escalation design. The first dose cohort consisted of a starting dose of 60 mg/m 2 , and there were no dose limiting toxicities. Enrollment is now open for patients for the second dose cohort of 90 mg/m 2 . The Phase 1b portion of the study is expected to commence after successful completion of BP1001-A monotherapy cohorts and is intended to assess the safety and efficacy of BP1001-A in combination with paclitaxel in patients with recurrent ovarian or endometrial tumors. Phase 1b studies are also expected to be opened in combination with gemcitabine in Stage 4 pancreatic cancer and combination therapy in breast cancer Our DNAbilize ® technology-based products are available for out-licensing or partnering. We intend to apply our drug technology template to new disease-causing protein targets to develop new liposomal antisense drug candidates for inclusion in our pipeline that meet scientific, preclinical and commercial criteria and file new patents on these targets. We expect that these efforts will include collaboration with key scientific opinion leaders in the field of study and include developing drug candidates for diseases other than cancer. As we expand our drug development programs, we will look at indications where a systemic delivery is needed and antisense RNAi nanoparticles can be used to slow, reverse or cure a disease, either alone or in combination with another drug. We are developing a molecular biomarker package to accompany prexigebersen treatment, the goal of which is to identify patients with a genetic profile more likely to respond to treatment thereby improving probability of success for this program. The emerging role of biomarkers has been enhancing cancer development over the past decade and has become a more common companion to many cancer development programs. We expect to develop molecular biomarker packages to accompany our new programs. We have certain intellectual property as the basis for our current drug products in clinical development, prexigebersen, BP1002, BP1003 and BP1001-A. We are developing RNAi antisense nanoparticle drug candidates based on our own patented technology to treat cancer and autoimmune disorders where targeting a single protein may be advantageous and result in reduced patient adverse effects as compared to small molecule inhibitors with off-target and non-specific effects. We have composition of matter and method of use intellectual property for the design and manufacture of antisense RNAi nanoparticle drug products. Corporate Information The Company was incorporated in May 2000 as a Utah corporation. In February 2008, Bio-Path Subsidiary completed a reverse merger with the Company, which at the time was traded over the counter and had no current operations. The prior name of the Company was changed to Bio-Path Holdings, Inc. and the directors and officers of Bio-Path Subsidiary became the directors and officers of Bio-Path Holdings, Inc. On March 10, 2014, our common stock ceased trading on the OTCQX and commenced trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbol “BPTH.” Effective December 31, 2014, we changed our state of incorporation from Utah to Delaware through a statutory conversion pursuant to the Utah Revised Business Corporation Act and the Delaware General Corporation Law. Our principal executive offices are located at 4710 Bellaire Boulevard, Suite 210, Bellaire, Texas 77401, and our telephone number is (832) 742-1357. On February 22, 2024, we effected a reverse stock split of our outstanding shares of common stock at a ratio of 1-for-20, and our common stock began trading on the spilt-adjusted basis on the Nasdaq Capital Market at the commencement of trading on February 23, 2024. All common stock share and per share amounts in this Registration Statement on Form S-1 have been adjusted to give effect to the 1-for-20 reverse stock split. 4 TABLE OF CONTENTS Recent Developments On March 12, 2024, we received a deficiency letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) notifying the Company that it is not in compliance with the minimum stockholders’ equity requirement of at least $2,500,000 for continued inclusion on The Nasdaq Capital Market pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) (the “Stockholders’ Equity Requirement”). In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(2)(A), the Company has 45 calendar days, or until April 26, 2024, to submit a plan to Nasdaq to regain compliance (the “Compliance Plan”) with the Stockholders’ Equity Requirement. If the Compliance Plan is accepted, Nasdaq can grant an extension of up to 180 days from the date of the letter for the Company to evidence compliance. If the Compliance Plan is not accepted, Nasdaq could provide written notification to the Company that its common stock may be delisted. At that time, the Company may appeal Nasdaq’s delisting determination to a Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”). If the Company timely appeals, it would remain listed pending the Panel’s decision. There can be no assurance that, if the Company does appeal the delisting determination by Nasdaq to the Panel, such appeal would be successful. The Company is considering available options to regain compliance with the Stockholders’ Equity Requirement. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in developing the Compliance Plan, that the Compliance Plan will be accepted by Nasdaq, or even if it is accepted, that the Company will ultimately be able to regain compliance with the Stockholders’ Equity Requirement within the allotted extension period, which may be less than 180 calendar days. 5 TABLE OF CONTENTS Description of Prior Registered Offerings and Private Placements The shares offered in this prospectus relate to the resale of an aggregate of 483,750 shares of our common stock issuable upon the exercise of the Warrants (as defined below) (including shares that may be issued to the holder in lieu of fractional shares).
