I have revamped and reorganized parsing code and logic, and have restructured the project as a set of interacting microservices meant to be self-hosted and self-contained.

I am currently implementing vector search logic for an RAG-based LLM for filing analysis, and will be rebuilding the flask frontend with this chatbot feature integrated.
